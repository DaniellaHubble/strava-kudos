By using [Cypress][cypress-href] as an executor, this application will kudo all newest [Strava][strava-href] activities.

âœ… Kudos all your newest Strava activities hourly (customizable by changing the [Github action scheduling][github-action-schedule])

âœ… Config once, using forever

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Step 1: Fork this repository

### Step 2: Deploying this project with Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fro-vn%2Fstrava-kudos)

Or you can deploy to Vercel manually by following these [steps](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-nextjs-with-vercel)

Once deployed, you will get a URL to see your app live, such as the following: https://strava-kudos.vercel.app (1)

### Step 3: Change Schedule time (if needed)

This application will kudos all activities on your Newfeed hourly (by default)
If you wanna schedule this execution, change the [cron value](./.github/workflows/strava-kudo.yml#5) of the `strava-kudo.yml` workflow in source code.

You can use [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/) to help generate your cron syntax and confirm what time it will run. To help you get started, there is also a list of [crontab guru examples](https://crontab.guru/examples.html).

### Step 4: Using Cypress dashboard for debugging/visualization results (Optional)

We are leveraging useful features of the Cypress Dashboard:

[Recording test results with the `record: true` option](https://on.cypress.io/how-do-i-record-runs) to the [https://on.cypress.io/dashboard]:

1.  In-depth and shareable [test reports](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/dashboard/runs).
2.  Visibility into test failures via quick access to error messages, stack traces, screenshots, videos, and contextual details.
3.  [Detecting flaky tests](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/dashboard/flaky-test-management) and surfacing them via [GitHub PR status checks](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/dashboard/flaky-test-management#GitHub).

To using Cypress Dashboard following these [steps]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqq-_QZWzhg]):

1. Link github account with [Cypress dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard)
2. Create a new project
3. Once created, you will get the `projectId` and [record key][github-secret] at (2)
4. Replace `projectId` at [cypress.json](./cypress.json) with your `projectId`

### Step 5: Add environment variables

[Cypress][cypress-href] need some environment variables to run correctly.

To protect our data, we will put it in [Encrypted secrets][github-secret]

The following environment variables should be provided

```
CYPRESS_BASE_URL  // Base URL of your application (1)
CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY // Record key of current project (2)
CYPRESS_STRAVA_PW // Strava's username
CYPRESS_STRAVA_USERNAME // Strava's password
```

Adding these params to repository's secret at `Setting -> Secrets -> New repository secret`
